        <h2>About This Site</h2>

        <p>
            The PHP file "config.php" which contains all of the credentials for connection to the PostgreSQL database is a modified version of a file called "get_cs25320_db_handle.php", which was made available by Edel Sherratt (eds) for use by students on the module.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>This webpage has been made as part of my assignment for the Programming for the Web module, CS25320. For the assignment I was tasked with creating a game using JavaScript. The webpage was made from scratch by me using HTML and CSS. The game’s code and all its assets were created mostly by me, apart from the following sections/assets:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The smooth player movement in my game is a heavily modified version of the code found at this web page: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15344104/smooth-character-movement-in-canvas-game-using-keyboard-controls">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15344104/smooth-character-movement-in-canvas-game-using-keyboard-controls</a>
            <br> The code was originally written by Stack Overflow user loktar and all code uploaded on Stack Overflow is usable under the Creative Commons license most commonly known as "CC BY-SA 3.0".
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Most text assets in my game were created using a tool at this web page: <a href="https://textcraft.net/">https://textcraft.net/</a>
            <br> Permission is not required by the site, and it’s not necessary to reference/attribute the page, but as it was a very useful tool in creating the assets for my game I decided that attribution was only fair.

        <p>The font ('Press Start 2P') used to display the score during the game and on the high score screen, as well as being used on this site for titles and links, can be found here: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P">https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P</a>
